# Actions

Having variables is great, but performing actions on them is even better.

There are type-specific actions:

- [Number](number/)
- [String](string/)
- [Array](array/)

and some that are not:

- equals
- strictly_equals
- does_not_equal
- does_not_strictly_equal
- greater_than
- greater_than_or_equal_to
- less_than
- less_than_or_equal_to
