# Language Constructs

- [Comments](#comments)

## Comments

You can comment your code using `#` or `//` so you won't forget what it does:

    final greeting "Hello"; // Define the greeting
    print greeting ", world!"; # Greet the world using the greeting we just defined

If you like comments that go for multiple lines and/or ASCII art, feel free to use `/*` and `*/`:
